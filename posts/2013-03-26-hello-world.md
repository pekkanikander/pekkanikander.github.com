## Time to get modern

The very first web site of my own I had back in the 1990s; for
example, the [Wayback Machine](web.archive.org) has captured a nice
snapshot of my [research home page from
1998](http://web.archive.org/web/19980624222606/http://www.tcm.hut.fi/~pnr/).
However, both my research and commercial home pages had already then
existed for some years, I just don't remember any more how long.
Since then, the pages have migrated a few times, and now I'm migrating
them again, this time to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com).  I
hope this migration and going from plain HTML to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) will bring them also to the modern time.

I have also resisted blogging and social web sites for a long time, a
clear sign that I'm getting old and perhaps too much privacy
concerned.  However, as Jekyll and Github Pages make blogging easy,
let's see if I manage to write something interesting.  Most probably
not; the most likely scenario is that in a year or two this will just
be yet another abandoned blog that nobody is following.  But we'll see.
