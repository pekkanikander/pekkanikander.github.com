<h1>NDSS 2003: Conference report</h1>

</p>

<p class="note">This is a <em>personal</em> report from my trip to San Diego
for the NDSS conferece.  This time this document describes mostly 
technical and research related material, since the food was worse than
average, there were no wines worth to mention, and I didn't have much
change to talk with interesting people.</p>

<h2>Executive summary
</h2>

<p><a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.isoc.org/">ISOC</a> 2003 Symposium on
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.isoc.org/ndss2003/">Network and Distributed
System Security</a> was held at
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.catamaranresort.com/">Catamaran Resort Hotel</a>
in 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.isoc.org/isoc/conferences/ndss/03/sandiego.shtml">
San Diego</a>, just like it has been held
several times earlier.  The actual conference took place 
on February 6-7, with tutorials held on the previous day.
</p>

<p>The conference program was quite interesting in the average, but
also diversed both in topics and quality.  From LMF / NomadicLab / my
own personal point of view, the most interesting issues included the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>John "JI" Ionnadis gave a <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#ipsec">keynote on IPsec</a>,
      touching issues such as IPsec usability, distributed firewalls,
      and how IPsec SPD design is able support symbolic names and
      dynamic binding.</li>
  <li>There were a couple of talks describing how to use
      hash chains based authentication for 
      <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#esmrp">routing protocols</a> and
      <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#sensenet">sensor networks</a>.</li>
  <li>There was a <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#privpanel">panel</a> on authentication and
      privacy.  From my point of view, perhaps the most interesting
      issue was <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#terminology">terminology</a>, or lessions
      to learn how to define identity, and consequently, identity
      authentication. </li>
  <li>Tools for detecting buffer overflows and other common
      programming errors. (several talks)</li>
  <li>Fighting against spam with 
      <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#spas">SPAs</a> and <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#mbf">memory bound functions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, it was very interesting to note that within this
community Mac OS X is really taking off.  Based on casual observation,
about one third of the laptops were Apples, mostly PowerBooks but also
some iBooks.  Many of the interesting people seemed to have switched
over to Mac OS X,, including Avi Rubin, Alper Yegin, and Steve Kent.
So, I am in good company with my new PowerBook G4 DVD-R. :-)</p>

<h1>Thursday, Feb 6th</h1>

<p>
After having arrived on Wednesday evening, after 21 hours of
travelling, and somehow surviving the welcome reception, I woke up at
3:30am after some seven hours of sleep.  Feeling much better than the
night before I was able to finalize my slide and process e-mail before
it started to dawn.  Walking along the shore of Mission Bay at the
time the sun was rising was lovely, but it was also very cold for
California, almost freezing.  However, after a couple of Tai Chi 24s I
was fresh and ready for the day.</p>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p class="speaker">Clifford Neumann</p>

<p>Clifford started by briefly describing the history NDSS.  NDSS was
started in 1993, initially as an independent workshop.  It has always
been intended to be a fairly small conference, to promote interaction
between speakers and the audience.  The focus is on actual system
design and implementation, not theory.  </p>

<p>In 1994 NDSS joined forces with Internet Societ. The conferences
grew quite large for a couple of years, but they are againsmaller now.
This year there was135 attendees.  The tutorial day added in 1998,
tutorials have been available ever since, and an outstanding paper
award has been given out since 2000.</p>

<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) is the largest sponsor for NDSS,
and has always been.  </p>

<p>Clifford handed over the podium to Virgil Gligor, progam co-chair,
who thanked the program committee.  This year there were 82 papers
submitted, 17 of which were accepted, by authors from Finland, France,
Sweden, and U.S.  The number of accepted papers has always been and
will keep on the level of 17-19 papers, due to the structure of the
conference.  Thus, given the ratio of accepted papers, NDSS is getting
to the same level with the Oakland and ACM CCS conferences.  </p>

<h2>Session 1: Invited Speaker</h2>

<p>The invited speach was planned to be <em>Total Information
Awareness (TIA)</em>, by Dr. Robert L. Popp from DARPA, but that was
cancelled on very short notice (previous day) since he seems to be
very busy at the Capitol hill.  Thus, we had the opportunity to enjoy
JI instead.</p>

<h3 id="ipsec"><a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.tla.org/talks/ipsec-dammit.pdf">
Why Don't we Still Have IPsec, dammit</a></h3>
<p class="speaker"><a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.tla.org/">
John "JI" Ionnadis</a>
</p>

<p>JI described his talk as six talks in one, since most of the same
could be said for IPv6, Mobile IP, PKIs, secure e-mail, and DNSSEC.
In general, it is easy to blame people, vendors (or a particular
vendor...), and the users.  Basically, it is a question of the network
effect, in the sense that all of these are kinds of technology which
are only useful if there are other people that have them, too.  These
just just like Like fax or telephone; a single telephone by itself is
completely useless.</p>

<p>JI continued his rant by noting that people who really know IPsec
can write it right, not IPSEC, IPSec, or Ipsec.  He also blamed
Microsoft Word, since it is almost impossible to spell IPsec correctly
with it.</p>

<p>Going to the real subject, IPsec is still missing configuration
languages, GUIs, management software, etc.  In a word, it is lacking
<em>ease of deployment</em>.  It is still hard to configure IPsec for
use; even JI usually turns to Angelos when he wants to configure IPsec
for something, prefering to use SSH for his own needs.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the problems with IPsec is that it is too modular
and too secure; the modularity and security goals may also have slowed
down the standardization too much.  The IPsec design decouples key
management, policy, and on the wire security protocols.  Making the
first versions of the standards took from 1992 to 1997, so roughly 4-5
years.  In the meanwhile, SSL (1995) happened, and SSH started to catch
on, firewalls started to get more sophisticated, NAT spread, and
layer-4 redirectors happened.  Thus, the need for IPsec diminished
and its operating environment changed.</p>

<p>Why then SSL and SSH spread while IPsec didn't?  SSL and SSH do not
need to be configured, at least not be the end user.  Whether the SSL
connections are really secure and does thatt matter, is a topic of a
separate talk.  SSL is there, dammit. </p>

<p>So why don't we have IPsec, part I?  The standardization took so
long that in the meanwhile SSL removed the urgency, as did SSH.  The
existing IPsec implementations were created by kernel hackers, and
they did not care too much about the users.  Most IPsec
implementations today have disgusting command line interfaces for key
management.</p>

<p>IPsec is currently everywhere and nowhere.  All major operating
systems have it, even embedded systems, routers, broadband modems, VPN
access software, etc.  But nobody really uses it because it is too
bloody hard to configure.  It <em>is</em> being used for VPN and some
remote/rowad warrior access, and it may come up on 3GPP phones, but it
is not in for general use.</p>

<p>From the management point of view, there are no standard APIs for
application to ask the network stack about security.  The existing
APIs that there are, getsockopt/setsockopt and PF_KEY, have different
semantics on different operating systems.  There is no real way of
defining policy at a high level.  The IETF IPSP WG is not doing much
progress.</p>

<p>So why, part II?  IKE is too complex.  JI is know for distributing
his "I dislike IKE" buttons.  IKE is a real pain to configure; I have
some personal experience on this, too. It really is a royal pain, not
just in JI's but also in my opinion.  </p>

<p>So why, part III?  Even though IPsec is being used by businesses,
integrating legacy systems with it is fairly hard.  Peer-to-peer IPsec
is not really useful without real PKIs.  Currently it is really hard
to set up app-to-app secure communications.  Application writers don't
know about IPsec, or they don't know they can use it, even on
Windows.</p>

<p>IPsec still counts for less than 1% of the Internet traffic.</p>

<p>What need to be done?  Firstly, remote access should be made
easier.  There is a great need for standardized, useful APIs.  We need
better configuration and management tools.  We need to make IPsec to
work nicer with the other tunneling protocols.  And finally, we need
to fix the implementations so that IPsec integrates better with host
routing within the hosts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have to prepare for the future needs. If IPsec
indeed happens, firewalls need to be redifined as policy enforcement
points.  When IPsec is used, "inside" and "outside" become defined by
keys, not by network topology. </p>

<p>Steven Bellovin's 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.research.att.com/~smb/papers/distfw.html">
Distributed Firewalls</a> paper, in the November 1999 issue of
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/">;login:</a>, 
described the basic ideas
in distributing the firewall into the hosts.  There also appears
to be a <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.distributedfirewalls.com/">dedicated
website</a> for spreading information about distributed firewalls.</p>

<p>In the discussion afterwards, Steve Kent noted that the SPD
<em>design</em> allows one to have symbolic identifiers in the SPDE,
so that the identifiers can the can be dynamically mapped to IP
addresses.  Thus, in theory, IPsec SPD would be able to support
mobility better than it does today, but people have not implented
that.  This may be something that we have to have a look at.</p>

<h2>Session 2: Mobility and Secure Routing</h2>

<p>
The first paper session was chaired by 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/">Bill Arbaugh</a>,
and focused on secure routing and mobility.  Thus, it appeared that
our paper was the only paper about secure mobility and that our paper
was clumbed together with two routing security papers.</p>

<h3 id="esmrp">Efficient Security Mechanisms for Routing Protocols</h3>

<p class="speaker"><a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~yihchun/">
Yih-Chun Hu</a></p> 

<p>The first paper in the conference focused on efficient security for
routing protocols.  The goal of the work was to make it possible to
verify routing packets at or near wire speed, using hash chains
instead of signatures.  In general, the talk was very interesting, and
the paper is most probably very worth reading.  (I haven't read it
yet, though.)</p>  

<p>The paper is available in 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.monarch.cs.rice.edu/monarch-papers/ndss03.pdf">
electronic form</a>.  
Related to the paper, 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/home.html">
Adrian Perrig</a>'s 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects.html">
projects web page</a> 
contains more information about the project.</p>

<p>The speaker started with describing distance vector routing
protocols.  In a distance vector protocol, a router basically
distributes its hop-count based routing tables periodically.  Sequence
numbers are used to make difference between older and newer versions
of the distributed routing info. </p>

<p>Most of the distance vector routing related work was already
presented in a 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/secure-routing/wmcsa02.pdf">
companion paper</a>, called <em>SEAD</em>,
where the authors introduced the idea of using
long hash chains to secure information in routing messages.  In the
original approach, they used a few consequtive hash values for
representing a single sequence number.  Within such a group, the
different hash values were used to represent different metrics, so
that an earlier hash within the group in the chain represents a better
route.  Furthermore, larger sequence numbers were represented by earlier
hashes in a sequence.  Thus, when a new sequence number was taken into
use, all the routes using old sequence numbers started to look much
worse, thereby becoming obsolete.</p>

<p>However, there remained a number problem in this scheme.  The first
problem was called the <em>same metric problem</em>.  In a distance
vector protocol, the routers increment the distances as they forward
messages received from other hosts.  In SEAD, the hosts are assumed to
increment the distances by hashing once more the received hash values,
thereby creating hash values that represent larger distances.  Now, in
a same metric attack an attacking router just replays the metric
instead of incrementing it.</p>

<p>As a solution to same metric problem, the authors introduced
<em>Hash Tree Chains</em>.  In a hash tree chian, they used a
converging hash tree for each sequence number, using separate hash
nodes in the hash tree for separate forwarding nodes.  This allows the
receiver to associate the metrics with specific nodes for which they
were created for, thereby noticing missing increments.</p>

<p>Accornding to the speaker, the used scheme is similar to
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://eprint.iacr.org/2002/014/">HORS signature scheme</a>; 
this is probably something
the we should check later on.</p>

<p>There is also a possibilityof a DoS attack.  In this attack a
router simply claims a very sequence number whose checking requires
the recipients to follow very long hash chains.  To alleviate this,
the authors introduced <em>skiplists</em>.  Basically, a skiplist is a
hash structure that allows one to "skip" fast forward within a hash
chain.  Thus, it is not a linear hash chain, but one that contains
"skips" over spans of hashes, allowing faster checking of large
chains.  To implement skiplists, the authors used 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/secure-routing/ariadne/node31.html">
Merkle-Winternitz</a> signatures.  </p>

<p>After describing their work on distance vector protocols, the
author continued with <em>path vector</em> routing protocols.
In a path vector protocol, the routing messages carry the names of the
nodes on a path instead of just a hop count.  </p>

<p>There are two basic attacks against path vector protocols:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alternation or removal of nodes on a path</li>
  <li>Masquerading as another node</li>
</ul>
<p>
The basic approach to secure against path alteration was again already
presented in
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/secure-routing/ariadne.pdf">
another paper</a>,
describing the <em>Ariadne</em> approach by the authors.
The authors now improved the Ariadne approach with cumulative
authentication that requires only a <em>constant</em> space overhead
independent of the path length.</p>

<p>The details of the approaches are in the paper.  In general, I
think that this was one of the most interesting talks in the
conference.</p>

<h3>Working around BGP: An Incremental Approach ...</h3>
<p class="speaker">Geoffrey Goodell</p>

<p>The second talk considered BPG security.  A large part of the talk
described BGP in general, how it hides some information, and why that
information needs to be unhidden so that one can perform source
verification and policy checking.  As we konw, bgp misconfiruation is
a common problem; having more information available maybe helps in
better determining the sources of the misconfugred information. </p>

<p>The speaker continued by noting that S-BGP (Secure BGP by Steve
Kent and others) has different goals than the present approach.
According to their classification, S-BGP aims for synchronous
authentication while the present approach, Interdomaoin Routing
Validation (IRV) provides asynchronous authentication. </p>

<p>The rest of the talk described the IRV system.  It is basically a
centralized, per AS repository of BGP data, Implemented in XML. 
The IRV repositories exchange data with each other, if I understood
correctly.  Whenever routers receive routing updates, they consult
their local IRV repository to verify that the updates match with the
currently known configuration.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, the approach was not very interesting.  It
seemd to be very complex, at least in implementation, and some of the
questions afterwards also questioned its security.</p>

<h3>Integrating Security, Mobility and Multi-Homing in a HIP Way</h3>
<p class="speaker">Pekka Nikander</p>

<p>The third talk in the morning session was my talk.  In general, I
think the talk went well, and there were a few clarifying questions
afterwards.  However, it appears that learning to think in a new way
is very hard for people in general.  Most of the current practioners
have been learned the structure of the Internet architecture at the
college, and they have never questioned whether it is good or not; it
just is.  Thus, understanding HIP requires that they start to think in
a new way, and that is not particularly easy.</p>

<h2>Lunch</h2>

<p>The lunch was served outside, at the lawns in the front of the
Mission bay.  The lunch was lasagne, almost not worth mentioning.</p>

<h2 id="privpanel">Session 3: Panel on Authentication and Privacy</h2>

<p>The afternoon was started by a panel on authentication and privacy.
Basically, the panel consisted of different points of view by some
members of the 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.cstb.org/">Computer Science and Telecommunications Board</a>
study
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://cstb.org/project_authentication.html">
committee</a>
investigating the implications authentication has on privacy.
</p>

<h3>Authentication and Privacy -- Some Observations</h3>
<p class="speaker">Steven Kent</p>

<p>The first presentation was given by Steve Kent, describing the
overall purpose and goals of the study.  Basically, their aim has been
to understand the interplay between authentication and privacy, and
their report is coming out soon.  The membership of the committee has
been quite diversed, representing different areas of expertese.  He
also underlined that affecting privacy does not always mean violating
privacy, and the committee's goal has been to understand all kinds of
consequences, not just violations.</p>

<p>When proposing this panel to NDSS, Steve's original intend was to
have the report out, and on the conference CD-ROM.  That didn't
happen, but the report will be out fairly soon.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p class="speaker">Bob Blakley</p>

<p>The second presentation, given by Bob Blackley, covered mostly
terminology.  Starting from fairly standard and uncontroversial
definitions for individual, name, and attribute, he continued to ones
with more subteties.</p>

<p>Firstly, the committee had come to the conclusion that
<em>identity</em> is in the eye of the observer.  Consequently, the
observer is called an identity system.  This has some interesting
implications.  For example, according to this definition, each of us
humans posses separate identity systems.  The definitions of the
identies of the individuals within our mental identity systems
overlap, but they are not necessarily identical.</p>

<p>Another interesting consequence is that not all identities must
refer to real individuals.  For example, <em>Lara Croft</em> is a
identity that many of us have, but itdoesn't have any individual there
behind.  Furthermore, It is also possible for individuals to have multiple
identities, tough it didn't become clear to me if an individual can
have multiple indetities within a single identity system..</p>

<p>Using thse definitions, <em>identification</em> is the process of
using attributes of an individual to infer who the individual is,
i.e., which identity does the individual possess within an identity
system.  It is noteworthy that people get this wrong relatively often
within their own mental identity system..</p>

<p>Secondly, <em>authentication</em> is the process of establishing
confidentce in the truth of some claim, and it doesn't have anything
to do with identification per se.  Even though the claim often
considers identities and individuals, it does not need to.
Very seldomly, if ever, authentication in itself is the end goal.
It is usually done for a purpose.  Authentication is typically used
for access control or for establishing accountability.</p>

<p>An <em>authenticator</em> is a piece evidence which is presented to
support authentication of a claim.  It increases confidence to the
claimed truth.</p>

<p>Bob next came to the distinction between <em>individual
authentication</em> vs. <em>identity authentication</em>.  From my
point of view, this is a very important but certainly also very subtle
issue.  Unfortunately Bob covered these so quickly that I didn't have
time to take any notes, and we have to wait for the report for the
final truth.  However, according to my (limited) understanding,
<em>individual authentication</em> consists of providing evidence that
a user/suspect/whatever really is a given individual, i.e., known
human being.  For example, fingerprints or face recognition (performed
by a human) can be considered as individual authentication.  
On the other hand, <em>identity authentication</em> consists of
providing evidence that a user/suspect/whatever really possesses or is
entitled to an identity defined by an identity system.  Providing an
account name and a password is a good example of (weak) identity
authentication.  It does not provide any confidence about the actual
individual using the system, but it does link the user and an identity
together. </p>

<p>Finally, <em>authorization</em> is the process of deciding what an
<em>individual</em> is allowed or not allowed to do.  I found it very
interesting that they defined authorization in the terms of
individuals instead of identities, but so they did.</p>

<p>In general it was very encouraging to me to see these definitions,
since they largely agree with the analysis I did in the introduction
of my
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.tml.hut.fi/~pnr/publications/PhDThesis.pdf">
Ph.D. Thesis</a> back in 1999.  Having these definitions soon out by a
committee of this high reputation should gradually lead to better use
of the terms in the literature.</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p class="speaker">Steven Bellovin</p>

<p>The next presentation was a pretty standard description of the
available authentication technologies, starting from the usual trinity
of something you are, something you know, and something your posses. </p> 

<p>Even though mostly old topics, Steve emphasized that the
technologies must be used in the right context.  For example, most
people consider passwords easy and cheap, though not necessarily
secure.  However, depending on the context, passwords can be really
expensive, in terms of revocation, replacement procedures, etc.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p class="speaker">Deidre Mulligan</p>

<p>The next presentation was perhaps the most interresting one to me.
Deidre Mulligan, a privacy expert, started by discussing how the
concept of privacy is very much dependent on the political system and
legal system.  It is contextual, cultural, and depends on the time
period.  Thus, the difficulty of defining what privacy means, exactly,
leads to dificulties in the discussion.</p>

<p>According to her, privacy can be divided into the following four dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information privacy
  <li>Bodily integrity
  <li>Decision privacy
  <li>Communcations privacy
</ul>

<p>Of these, information privacy seems to be on most jeopardy by
modern information systems.  Basically, information privacy means that
even when an individiual is giving out information in an transaction,
that does not mean that the recipient may do anything he or she wishes
with that information.  The information is given only for a specific
purpose, and by the information privacy principle it must not be used
for other purposes.</p>

<p>Bodily integrity is easy to understand; in our culture, everybody
considers their body private, and there must be an explicit reason for
bodily searches or other violations of bodily integrity.</p>

<p>Decision privacy relates to our ability to make our own choices.
Basically, it includes the freedom to decide how to raise you
children, to chooce you religion, etc.  In my personal view, decision
privacy may be the most culturally dependent of the four.</p>

<p>Communciations privacy is very much a subset of information
privacy.  In covers issues such as our expectations about the privacy
of first class mail, telephone calls, etc.  In a word, it provides
special protection for information privacy in the communication
context.</p>

<p>Deidre spoke fairly long and about many important issues.  However,
I started to be tired (Can you spell jet lag? -- I guess I couldn't at
that time).  Thus, I just couldnt' make notes of all, and I ndeed to
resolve in noting a few important issues that she mentioned.</p>

<p>One of the issues that she talked about was the concent and
requirement of interaction by the individuals.  Today, most
authentication technologies require some interaction by the
individual.  But some things, like automated face scanning, i.e.,
covert authentication system, don't require any interaction by the
individual being identified.  This is clearly a problem, but I don't
know how to classify it within the four mentioned categories, and I
don't remember if she did.</p>

<p>A couple of other issues mentioned were the proliferation of (low
grade) authentication systems everywhere, the problems with
aggrecation of data. </p>

<p>Overall, Deidre, like Steve Bellovin earlier, emphasized that 
the privacy implications always need to be evaluated in some context.
Otherwise the talk is extremely abstract, and she apologized that her
talk was this time exactly that, extremely abstract.</p>

<h3>Other issues</h3>
<p class="speaker">Steve Kent</p>

<p>The final speaker before questions was Steve Kent, again.  This
time he described some of the problems, such as secondary use of
identifiers, identity theft being very much as a side effect of
authentication system design choices, etc.  He also spoke about the
special role of the government both as an issuer and a consumer of
credentials.  With private organizations you can make a choice, but it
is a little harder to change your government.</p>

<p>In general, again, Steve emphasized that privacy is very much a
system issue, very context dependent.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>The presentations were followed by half an hour session with
questions from the audience.  Some of the more interesting notes are
collected below.</p>

<!--
Q: Experiences from other countries?</p>
A: Blakley: Yes.  But the report does not include a detailed
analysis. 

Q: Google.  Focus on authentication is missing the ball? 
The kind of information is becoming available to everybody all the time.
A: Mulligan: Becoming more difficult to preserve.  Framing a privacy
analysis.  Useful to think about the other
Blakley: There are people that don't show up at google at all.
Important to encouage the category of hits that seem to have 
something to do with me but are false.  
Kent: Transaction records typically don't show up in google.
Worried about linking the transaction records and other information.
Blakley: There are lots of activities that don't take place
in the digital world.  
Mulligan: Different kinds of information.  But sometimes different
types of information may be used for similar ends.  
Bellovin:  Easy accessibility.  Genealogy database, mother's maiden
name is soon not of any good.  
-->

<p>There is a difference between the kind of information available by 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.google.com/about.html">google</a> by examining
transaction records.  We should really be worried about the possible
linkage of transaction records and other kinds of more readily
available information.</p>

<!--
Q: JI: Privacy implications of data on a national ID card.
Kent: Did consider the process of what should go to considering
a natinal ID system.  First, it should be made very clear what is the
problem to be solved.  Expecially concerns with secondary use.  For
example, is the driver's license system already a natial ID system.
-->

<p>Bob Blackely noted that identity theft is possible since we deal
much more with strangers than we used to do.  There is a difference
between a small community and the current socity.  One of the problems
is that Third party assurances are of unknown value.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the committee did consider some measures that
could be done, like recommending limited scope PKIs, recognizing the
fact that people legitimately have different identities for different
contexts, authorization from authentication, and acknowledging that
there are times where you don't have to authenticate someone in order
to find out whether they have the authorization. 

<!--
 Blakley: A
discussion on how to think about the tradeoffs when designing a
system.  Bellovin: Should use attributes in travel identity card.
Blakely: What you using the identity for.  Naive notion that identity
is needed while it is really something else.

Q: 
Mulligan:  Paper related to Ross Anderson's paper.  First personal
fictional account about a doctor, authentication and liability
problems.  Fear flowing.   Limitations of liability.  Consumers are
not in the best position to judge.

Q: What was suprising.
Mulligan: Researchers that cut of relative's thumbs.
Blakley: The difficulty of the issue.  Not: Authentication is either a
solved problem or a marketing authority.  Given that the
authentication answer is yes/no, it is surpicing how difficult the issue is.
Kent: Same social security numbers given to several peoples.
In 1950s wallet manufacturs with little plastic windows.
A nontrivial part of the population with social security number 123-4567-89
Blakley: The system was issuing the same social security number to a
husband and to a wife that didn't work. 
-->

<h2>Rest of the day</h2>

<p>After the panel I was so tired that I went to sleep.  I had a wake
up alarm at 7pm for the banquet, but I just couldn't get up.  Thus, I
continued sleeping until 3am, and started to work after that.</p>

<h1>Friday, Feb 7th</h1>

<p>The skies were clear in the morning, like the day before, and this
time I was prepared for the cold.  I also crossed the peninsula to see
the ocean.  There were people surfing, in wetsuits, already that
early (6:30am).  Californian lifestyle, I guess.e</p>

<h2>Session 5: Fault and intrusion detection</h2>

<p>The first session in the second day concentrated on vulnerability and
intrusion detection.  It was a long session, with four papers, and I
didn't find any of them particularly interesting, but that may be just
because I don't care that much about the topic areas.</p>

<h3>Comparison of tools for detecting buffer overflows and other
programming errors</h3>
<p class="speaker">John Wilander</p>

<p>The presentation and paper compared various tools for dynamic
(runtime) discovery of buffer overflows, format string attacks, and
other similar attacks utilizing programming mistakes.  The same
authors had compared Tools for static (compile time) discovery in 
an earlier paper that had appeared  at NordSec'02.</p>

<p>In the current paper, four tools were tested: StackGuard,
Stackhield, ProPolic, and Libsafe/Libverify.  ProPolice appeared to be
best of the four tested.</p>

<h3>Traps and Pitfals in System Call Interposition based Security Tools</h3>
<p class="speaker">Tal Garfinkel</p>

<p>Intrusion detection by interposing (tracing/spyking) system calls
have become a popular technology after the 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/janus/">Janus</a> paper
 won the best paper award at Usenix.  Current existing tools
include: Janus, MapBox, Systrace, and various kinds of software
Wrappers.</p>

<p>The main point in the presentation was that the system call
interface is complex, not well documented, changes over time, and not
designed for interposition.  Consequently, the tools turn out to be
quite broken in practise; the authors found holes in every tool they
looked at.  However, all the problems described the the talk were
fairly subtle, seeming to require detailed knowledge about the tool
used.</p>

<p>I am not very convinced about the value of the paper, but it
certainly helps to break some overly confidence people may have on
Janus and friends.</p>

<h3>Detecting Service Violations and DoS Attacks</h3>
<p class="speaker">Ahsan Habib</p>

<p>The speaker had a very hard accent, making the talk very hard to
understand.  Consequently, I didn't really try to listen to the talk.
However, based on the slides, the paper seemed to include a very good
analysis of the various DoS prevention tools and techniques
available.  I would recommend studying the paper for those people that
are interested in DoS attacks and their prevention.</p>

<h3>A Virtual Machine Introspection based Architecture 
for Intrusion Detection</h3>
<p class="speaker">Tal Garfinkel</p>

<p>The idea of this talk was to use a Virtual Machine Monitor to
co-locate an Intrusion Detection System at a physical host, but run it
in a really isolated protection domain, a separate virtual machine.
This leads to a situation where the IDS is isolated from the watched
operating environment, but where is has good visibility to watch its
target and detect suspiciously looking activity.  In a way, the
technique gives a view from below.</p>

<p>Since the topic of the talk was really beyond my area of expertese
and my interests, I didn't listen too closely, even though the
practical implementation using VMware sounded interesting..</p>

<h2>Session 6: Spam and IP Telephony</h2>

<p>The second session before lunch concentrated on spam prevention, but
also contained a talk about IP Telephone security.  I basically
skipped the latter one; the paper is probably interesting to teh SIP
people, though.</p>

<h3 id="spas">Why do we still have spam, dammit</h3>
<p class="speaker">JI, again</p>

<p>We had another chance to enjoy listening to JI.  As everybody
agrees, spam is bad.  A significant fraction of JIs e-mail is spam;
mine likewise.  </p>

<p>Spam is a social desease.  Spammers are not in the same community
as we are.  JI doesn't hang out with spammers; neither do I.</p>

<p>We can try legistlating against spam, but that has its own problems,
which JI didn't want to go to in his speech.</p> 

<p>Spam starts with exposure, by giving out your e-mail address an an
on-line forum, by buying something on-line, or even sometimes by
person-to-person messages.  We give out the e-mail address since we
want the recipients to be able to answer to us.  There is always also
a <em>reason</em> why we want them to be able to respond to us.</p>

<p>The situation is complicated because e-mail addresses are long-lived,
and therefore they sooner or later end up in spam lists, and there is
no real way of getting them removed.  So, we want the e-mail addresses
to have an <em>expiration date.</em> </p>

<h4>From spam to SPAs: Single Purpose Addresses</h4>

<p>Arriging to the core of his talk, he proposed to combat spam with
SPAs.  Basically, we need to define a policy under which conditions a
received e-mail message is acceptable:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what: a purpose for the e-mail</li>
  <li>whence: time limit within which the address is acceptable</li>
  <li>who: expected sender's address who may use the address</li>
</ul>
<p>
In most transactions you want the e-mail address to be usable for
a while, maybe once or twice.  Somewhat similar to single use credit
card numbers.
</p>

<p>Now, the idea of SPAs is to use unique email addresses that encode
policy.  The policy must be enforced by the creator of the address in
such a way that random addresses must not work.  In practice, a simple
SPA address encodes an expiration date and an expected sender's address
into a base32 encoded user name portion of an e-mail address.</p>

<p>Mailing lists are a problem for SPAs since the recipients address
in only in the envelope.  Thus, JI made a little hack that adds the
envelope address into a X-SPA-To: header so that the recipient
address is indeed visible in the received e-mail message.</p>

<p>It must be noted that SPAs are just another set of tools in the
toolbox, with the big benefit that it does not need any local state to
be remembered.  It is not a panacea.  For example, a
challenge-response system is much more appropriate for already exposed
addresses.  On the other hand, what is really good about SPAs is that
if enough people start using them, it will make the spam lists larger,
and cause more costs to the spammers.</p>

<p>During the discussion, somebody suggested that the system could be
augmented with a web site that can be used to request one-time short
time addresses that are valid for only one sender.  In that way
real people can get an e-mail address for you, but they don't do much
good for spammers.  Of course, if needed, such a web site can include
a human recognition feature, making it virtually impossible for
spammers to create any automatic way of gettinng such addresses.</p>

<p>A down side of SPAs is that it is currently practically impossible
to get code released from AT&amp;T, and therefore the system is not
available.  However, JI urged people to read the paper, to reimplement
the system, and to put in in public.  I think this would be a great
student project for someone.  Besides, having JI on your side is not
that bad thing...</p>

<h3 id="mbf">Modelrately hard, memory-bound functions </h3>
<p class="speaker">Mike Burrows, Microsoft Research</p>

<p>The second paper in the session got the outstanding paper award in
the conference.  Like the paper, the talk was good, as you would
expect from Mike Burrows.  Basically, he described a class of
<em>memory intesive</em> functions that can be used to used to
implement protocol puzzles.</p>

<p>The functions described can be described as a form weak
cryptography that runs approximately the same speed on most of
computers.  Since they are memory bound and not CPU bound, the
difference in CPU speeds does not affect the run-time of the functions
that much.  Instead, these functions are designed in such a way that
they cause constant cache misses, making the CPU - memory interface
the bottleneck.  Since there is less variation on the speed of the
main memory, the present functions run at approximately same speed 
a large class of current computers, from top model servers to
PDAs.</p> 

<p>Mike started his talk by talking about the basic models of
preventing spam, DoS in general.  While there are several method, the
current work is based on the idea of requiring a payment somehow,
making people to pay by money, attention, or computation.  And it is
computation, or actually memory access, that people pay with in this
time.  </p>

<p>Earlier works have relied on CPU-intensive computations, but
machines vary widely in CPU power.  The trick away from the CPU speed
variations is not to spend CPU but memory bandwith, since the gap in
memory-system performance is much smaller.  Thus, memory-bound
functions should be more egalitarian.</p>

<p>Thus, the goal of this work was a family of problems that take
many cache misses to solve, e.g. in order of 2^23 cache misses, is much
faster to set and check, and be expressed and answered concisely, can
be made harder by changing a parameter, and solving one problem
doesn't help with others.  The requirements are pretty similar to the
CPU-intensive puzzle schemes other than to the use of cache
misses.</p>

<p>After considering a number of possible constructes, they 
decided to use some near-random function F(), and require reversing a
series of applications.  That is, the recipient would select a random
number <em>x</em>, apply F() repeatedly on that, producing a
series F(x), F(F(x)), F(F(F(x))), and finally compute a checksum over
the series.  It would then hand out the final value in the series, 
F^k(x), and the checksum to the sender.  The sender needs to search
out the path from the final value to x, and return it back to the
reciepient.</p>

<p>The function F() is constructed in such a way that the most
efficient way of inverting is to store the inverse values in a table
and to index that table directly.  Furthermore, since F() is (near)
random, any given image <em>y</em> is likely to have a number of
pre-images <em>F^-1(y)</em>.  This results in a tree of pre-images
rooted at the value F^k(x).  The sender has to search over this tree
space, test each path in the tree with the checksum, and finally
return the path that matches with the checksum.</p>

<p>Most modern computers have a few megabytes of cache.  To force
cache misses it is necessary to use a large enough pre-image to
access.  It appears that a space size 2^22 - 2^23 seems to be
appropriate, i.e., to use more than 8MB but less than 64MB of memory.
In the tree functions used, an appropriate tree depth appears to be
between 2^11 - 2^13, or the square root of the space size.  However,
it should not be much larger, or the become some CPU intensive
shortcuts available.</p>

<p>In their empirical experiments, a WinCE based 300 MHz PDA was about
five time slower than a 2.4 GHz top end server.</p>

<p>In general, the talk was very good, and I found out the paper to be
excellent.  A required read for anyone dealing with DoS resistance.</p>

<h3>Secure IP telephony Using Multi-layered Protection</h3>
<p class="speaker">Brennen Reynolds, UC Davis</p>

<p>This talk focused fairly much on how IP telephony and SIP works.
Since I personally couldn't care less about SIP, I basically just
skipped the talk.  However, reading the paper is probably useful for
people working with SIP and frieds.</p>

<h2>Lunch</h2>

<p>The lunch was served out, at the lawns, like yesterday.  This the
the dish was slightly better, roasted something, and actually almost
delicious. </p>

<h2>Session 7: Cryptography</h2>

<p>The first session after the lunch concentrated on crypto.  As you
probably know, I am not a cryptographer, and never will be.
Consequently, I didn't get too much from this session.</p>

<h3>Proxy cryptography revisited</h3>
<p class="speaker">Anca-Andreea Ivan</p>

<p>I have to confess I didn't understand the point of this talk at
all.  Read the paper if you are interested.</p>

<h3>Proactive Two-Party Signatures for User Authentication</h3>
<p class="speaker">Antonio Nicolosi</p>

<p>The authors looked for solutions in a situation where the users
want to create signatures using a software only client, where the
user does not completely trust the client computer.  Under these
conditions, the user can't use her public key directly at the client.
</p>

<p>One possible solution is to split the private key, and to create
a signature at two different computers:  An initial but still invalid
signature is created by the user at the partially trusted client,
using a key half available only at the client.  The signature is then
validated by a second key half, available at a partially-trusted
server.</p>

<p>The server keeps a log of the signatures it helps to sign.  The
server endorses signatures and logs all accesses.  Additionally, the
server can also act as a repository for the user's encrypted key half.
But is is still hard to recover if Alice's key half gets compromised.</p>

<p>Thus, we arrive to proactive two-party signatures.  Add a refresh
protocol to re-randomize the <em>sharing</em> of the key.  Thus,
whenever the sharing is refreshed, a possibly compromised user's half
of the key is rendered useless.</p>

<p>Good talk and good work, if you happen to need this kind of a scheme.</p>

<h2>Session 8: </h2>
<h3>Efficient Multicast Packet Authentication</h3>
<p class="speaker">Refik Molva</p>

<p>A multicast setting is an asymmetric setting.  A generator
generates messages, and a number of verifiers verify them.  
The setting is <em>lossy</em>; not all packet reach all
recipients.  Due to the nature of the application protocols, the
situation is usually also <em>space and time constrained</em>.
That is, the authentication code should use a fairly small amount of
space in a packet, and it must be fast to either verify (pre-recorded
data) or generate and verify (real-time) packets.</p>

<p>To achieve the space and time constraints, the usual methods
applied is <em>signature amortization</em>.  That is, the cost of
signature verification is divided over a number of packets.  
There are three popular techniques for signature amortization:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hash trees</li>
  <li>Hash chains</li>
  <li>Forward error correction (FEC)
</ul>

<p>This paper concetrated on error correction codes to recover hashes
on a lossy channel.  Special type of error codes, called erasure codes,
that work on blocks (like in block ciphers).  For example, Tornado
Codes that are based on xor.</p>

<p>The basic idea is compute hashes over packets to be sent, and then
create a signature over all of the hashes.  Additionally, to provide
robustness against packet losses, one creates error correction codes,
and conceptually adds them to the signature.  The error correction
codes allow recovery from packet losses, and still be able to compute
the hash values for the packets and to verify the signature.</p>

<p>The signature and error correction codes can be send in a previous
batch of packets, along with the packets to be checked, or piggybacked
on the next bunch of packets.  The method depends on the needs of the
application.  In all cases, there is a need for buffering, and
therefore the present method is not suitable for real-time media.</p>

<h3 id="sensenet">Efficient Distribution of Key Chain Commitments for
Broadcast Authentication in Distributed Sensor Networks</h3>
<p class="author">Peng Ning</p>

<p>Sensors need to authenticate commands received from the (more
powerful) base stations.  Sensors are resource constrainted, low
computational capabilities, low storage space, slow communications,
and maybe even energy constrains.</p>

<p>The work described is based on 
<a href="/web/20120406202951/http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects.html#TESLA">uTESLA</a>, 
and it
extends into what the authors called Multi-level uTESLA.  Basically,
they enhanced uTESLA with a new hash chain initialization protocol
that is based key predetermination and which is thereby able to use
broadcast instead of unicast.  In a way, the method may be described
as using a high level key chain to authenticate commintes in low level
key chains.</p>

<p>While alone I didn't find this paper too interesting, it gave a
nice contrast to <a href="/web/20120406202951/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/ndss2003-report.html#esmrp">the first regular paper in the 
conference</a>, which described how to use hash chains to secure
routing messages.</p>

<h2>Rest of the day</h2>

<p>Similar to the previous day, I became really tired during the
afternoon.  There were relatively few people left after the closing
remarks, and I didn't meet anyone with whom I had been able to go to a
dinner.  Thus, I bought a roll, some crisps, and a beer from a local
deli, and went early to bed, allowing me to wake up 4am fresh and
ready for the return flights.</p>
