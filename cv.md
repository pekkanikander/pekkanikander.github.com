## Profile

Dr. Pekka Nikander has over 30 years software development
expertise. In 1980 he wrote his first program while still in high
school, five years later patching live UNIX kernel to fix bugs.  Today
Pekka is a multi-talented software generalist, able to work on all
layers from hardware-software interface to user interfaces.

### Career overview

In 1988 Pekka founded [Nixu](https://www.nixu.com), today a leading computer and network
security consultant company in Finland, driving it for over 10 years,
followed by another 10 years at various leadership roles at Ericsson
Research.

During the time at Ericsson he grew to be an internationally
recognised expert in Internet architecture, with special attention to
security, privacy, mobility, economic, and implementation aspects. He
has a strong background in UNIX, all levels of programming from FPGAs
and system programming to compiler design and graphical user
interfaces, and computer and communications security. In early 1990s,
he spend a few years focusing on user interface aspects, creating a
user centric perspective that has remained active since then. From 1996
until 2006 he was active in Internet standardisation, and served
at the [Internet Architecture Board (IAB)](https://www.iab.org) from
March 2005 to February 2006. From 2007 until 2010 his work focused on
the future of the Internet architecture, with special attention to
socio-economic, implementation, scalability, and high performance
aspects.

In March 2011 he joined [Senseg](http://www.senseg.com), a leading
haptics startup, taking the responsibility for the software
architecture. In 2013, Pekka founded the
[Ell-i open source co-operative](https://ell-i.org) with a dozen of
other people.  In 2014, Pekka was nominated a Research Fellow at Aalto
University school of Science and Technology (the former Helsinki
University of Technology).  Furthermore, in 2014 Pekka co-founded
[Solu Machines](http://www.solu.co) together with Kristoffer Lawson
and Javier Reyes, leaving it a year later due to internal disputes.
From January 2016 to September 2016 he was the Chief Software
Architect at PulseOn.

Today Pekka is a Professor (PoP) of Industrial Internet at Aalto
University COMNET, CTO of [Ll co-op](https://luottamuksenloyly.fi),
and one of the founding members of
[ValueCraft](http://valuecraft.coop).

### Expertise

Pekka is first and foremost a generalist. He has more than 10 years of
experience, both at personal and at group-leadership level, on
architecting, designing, and implementing secure and scalable
distributed and decentralised systems, including protocol stacks. He
has written some half a million lines of code, mostly in C and Java
but also in a dozen or so other languages, including Verilog, various
assemblers, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, SmallTalk, Scheme, and
Common Lisp.  The platforms range from the Stanford NetFPGA through
microcontrollers, various Unix kernels and the iPhone, to the LLVM
compiler toolkit and system dynamics modelling.  Today he enjoys most
working with microcontrollers solving demanding hardware-software
co-design problems.

In addition to the technical skills, Pekka has had a leadership role
for more than 20 years.  While he has never enjoyed formal management
positions, he tends to lead people with his own example and
initiative. He enjoys solving technically "impossible" challenges in
small groups, aiming for the marine corps maxim "the impossible we do
at once, miracles take a bit longer!"

At the other end of the spectrum, Pekka has some experience in deep
organisational development, using methods such as World Cafe,
Openspace and Theory U, which aim at being able to reveal, understand
and change the deep landscape of organisations.

Pekka has authored or co-authored about 100 refereed scientific
articles, and is the inventor or a co-inventor in some 20 priority
patents.

Pekka has first-hand experience on seven startup companies: Nixu,
Senseg, Ell-i, Solu, PulseOn, Ll co-op, and ValueCraft.  Additionally,
during his Ericsson times he ran two startup ideas for a few months
each, before finding out that the markets were not ready for the
ideas.
