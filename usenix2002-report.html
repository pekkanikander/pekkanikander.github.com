to remember what actually happened, and what kind of connections I was
able to do.</p>

<h2>General remarks</h2>

<p>For me, Usenix does not seem like a conference worth visiting any
more.  It is too much operating systems oriented, and I am not an OS
guy any more.  On the other hand, the trip was certainly worth taking,
largely due to the chance to create so many contacts with the Berkeley
people at the CITRIS meeting <a href="/web/20120408015509/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/usenix2002-report.html#citris">(see below)</a>.  But
still, I had good talks and met interesting people at the conference
site corridors and during coffee breaks.</p>

<p>Thus, there were lots of talking and ideas for hacks
that use positioning, GPS etc, or connect devices in a stranged way,
like putting a digital camera directly to WLAN (it didn't work).  And
having fun with gedgets in general. </p>

<p>I became to the conclusion that I definitely need to beef up my toy
budjet in a way or another.  Right now I am acting far too
regressively, relying on old stuff that works, and therefore I am
dropping behind on what actially can be done with the new cool stuff.
Now that I don't have enough of money on your toy budget, I end up
only buying those toys that <em>look</em> useful before I buy
them. That usually means they are the wrong toys, those that are not
fun at all after all and end up on the shelf instead of getting
actually used.</p>

<p>To summarize: You can't build infrastructure without understanding
the users and their needs, and the manifestation of those needs in the
form of appliances.  Motto:  Buy gadgets, and use them.</p>

<h2>Monday June 10th</h2>

<p id="roth">I arrived at SFO at 12:30pm, after having been able to do quite a
lot of serious work during the flights, including paper review, slide
preparation, and other stuff.  The weather was somewhat hot, but not too
bad.  I quickly got my rental car and headed towards Berkeley,
arriving there few minutes before 2pm.  After some hassle I found
myself drinking decent cappucino at 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www-personal.si.umich.edu/~ishriles/cafe.proj/cafes/stradatitle.html">
Cafe Strada</a> with 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.igd.fhg.de/~vroth">Volker Roth</a> and 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.hiit.fi/martti.mantyla/">Martti Mantyla</a>.  
We talked about
security, trust, and user interfaces related stuff, finding out that
most probably Volker and 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cs.hut.fi/~karvonen/">Kristiina Karvonen</a> may
share some interests, and agent based search engines, which Martti
found somewhat fascinating.</p>

<p>After coffee Martti introduced me to SIMS, arranged my WLAN card to
work on the SIMS network (thanks Martti!), and finally we went for a
early dinner at a local Thai place, located two blocks down from
Bancroft on Telegraph Avenue, half a block away from the Telegraph.
We eventually shared the dishes, since the seafood platter Martti
recommended was not quite worth mentioning, but the roasted duck he
took himself was excellent.</p>

<p>I stayed at 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.radisson.com/berkeleyca/">Berkeley Marina Radisson</a>, 
which was OK
to stay at, but it is really in the middle of nothing.  Nice and cozy
place to spend a peaceful night, but you need a car or take the bus to
get somewhere.</p>

<h2>Tuesday June 11th</h2>

<p>I woke up at 5am, more or less as expected, and headed to the
Berkeley campus to read e-mail as soon as possible.  It was fairly
hard to find a good parking place that early, since all pay-per-hour
public parking places were still closed, and there are only 2 hour
parking places at the streets.  Finally I ended up parking the car at
street, and moving it after 7am to the Student Union Garage.</p>

<h3 id="citris">CITRIS Founding Corporate Members meeting</h3>

<p>I spent most of my day at the CITRIS Founding Corporate Members
meeting.  
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.citris.berkeley.edu/">CITRIS, 
Center for Information Technology Research in the
Interest to Society,</a> is a new University of California institute for
societally related technology research.  The participating campuses
are UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Modesto.  CITRIS
represents a new form of interaction between industry, academia, and
the state.  In one way, its funding model represents pretty much that
of <a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.hiit.fi/">HIIT</a>.  The university provides the
basic operational funding, but the corporations almost all of the
research.  There seems to be a difference on the role of the state
though, at least so far.  CITRIS seems to be much more oriented in
producing results that have more direct relevance to the state than
HIIT does, and therefore the state is also providing more direct
funding to CITRIS than what HIIT is getting (not counting the Tekes
support which is more or less an extension to industry funding).</p>

<p>For the current year, CITRIS operational (administrative) turnover
is around 2 million dollars, and the research volume about 40 million
dollars.  CITRIS has industry related two boards, the Technical
Advisory Board (TAB), which consists of research oriented people from
the founding members, and the Management Advisory Board (MAB), which
is more adminstratively oriented.  The Technical Advisory Board meets
every 6 months, and the Management Advisory Board annually.</p>

<p> The university is planning a new CITRIS II building.  The work is
scheduled to start in 2003 and be ready in 2005.  The state will be
paying the building, the corporate members the research inside the
building.  All the Founding Corporate Members are entitled named
offices in the building, up to three persons, once it is ready.</P>

<p>The Founding Corporate Members are expected to pay six million
dollars over four years.  However, only three of the nine FCMs seem to
be on the speed.  Ericsson's current contributions fall into the
middle of all FCMs.  
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~newton/main/frontpage.html">
Richard Newton</a>, Dean of
Engineering, mentioned that it is <em>expected</em> that some
financieers will tilt their contributions towards the end of the four
year period due to the current economic situation. </p>

<h4>Scientific Strategy</h4>

<p>The scientific strategy centers around three issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Societal-Scale Applications that have an impact on the quality
      of life, e.g., disaster recovery,
      transportation management, or environmental enginering.</li>
  <li>New Distributed System Architecture, based on <em>large scale
      sensing and actuation</em> and fail safe design</li>
  <li>Applying technology break throughs, such as nanotechnology.
</ul>
<p>
In a way, the purpose is to apply new technology on the societal scale
applications by developing a new distributed system architecture that
allows the large scale deployment scenarios.  The system architecture
binds together distributed information systems, micro sensors and
actuators and HCI principles.  The work is based on the foundations of
reliability, availability, security, algorithms, and social &amp;
policy issues.  The idea is do <em>wide scale</em> prototype
deployment, using test beds that allow new and innovative applications
to be easily tested. 
</p>

<p>CITRIS is expected to make a difference through large scale
deployment of new IT technologies on societal problems.</p>

<p>The Chief Scientist and Associate Director of CITRIS is
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/">James Demmel</a>.</p>

<h4>Mode of operation</h4>

<p>CITRIS works closely with the industrial financiers, encourages
transfer of people between CITRIS and the financieers.  The
administration is lean and mean, focusing on providing support for the
actual projects and the prototype platforms.  The projects are
independent, but CITRIS coordinates them and encourages co-operation
where feasible, if I understood correctly.</p>

<p>Each Founding Corporate Member is eligible for membership in the
Advisory Boards.  Additionally, they will have a possiblity of having
a named office in the new building once it is build.  CITRIS is also
prepared to spend a day separately with each member, focusing on the
research issues that are of interestest to the FCS.  There will be
possibilities for large scale online participation, such as remote
Master's programs and other remote education.  Finally, each research
project is expected to have an annual retreat with indiustry members
participating. <p>

<h4>Selected research projects</h4>

<p>In the meeting quite a few people presented a largish number of
research projects.  Most of them have good websites, and therefore I
mention here just a few that I found myself interesting.  In general,
the goal in everything are systems that can be trusted (and often must
be trusted), systems that must be secure, non-stop, often zero
configuration, contain adaptive user interfaces, and that are always
connected. </p>

<p>For me, one of the most interesting things were Berkeley MOTEs,
small autonomic computers that contain sensors and radio units and
that autonomously form ad hoc networks.  They run <a
href="/web/20120408015509/http://webs.cs.berkeley.edu/tos/">TinyOS</a>.  The plan is
to instrument several buildings with these, and to control the HVAC
(Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) of the buildings with these.</p>

<p class="note">Side note.  According to 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/ABOUTUS/staff-edward.htm">Ed Arens,</a> 
10% of world's energy consumption,
equaling 1/3 of U.S. energy consumption, goes to the heating and air
conditioning of U.S. buildings.</p>

<p>The percieved future of the MOTes was outlined by
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://sierra.ece.ucdavis.edu/html/html/yoo.html">Ben Yoo</a> 
(UC Davis) and 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/~howe/">Roger Howe</a>.
Their goal is to build systems with ultralow communcations power
requirements, giving 1 Mbps with less than one microwatt.  The
approach is based on integrating CMOS and MEMS (Micro
Electro-Mechanical Systems) together, to form reconfigurable signal
processing systems that consist of both reprogrammable hardware and
software.  The effort aims to drop total power consumption, eventualy
allowing the devices to power themselves autonomoysly even indoors,
e.g. through energy harvesting or indoors solar power. </p>

described his
efforts on distance learning and rapid prototyping.  His has run and
plans to run classes together with industry partners.  The students
design new electronic applicances, and they are actually prototyped

<h3>Down to San Jose</h3>

<p>I was pretty exhausted after the meeting, but I still managed to
drive to 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.hamptoninn.com/">Hampton Inn</a> & Suites San Jose,
checking on the way whether there was anything worth buying at 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.frys.com/">Fry's Electronics</a>
(there wasn't).  The hotel was nice, I had free high speed Internet
access in my room, and the pool was almost immediately next to the
room.  The pool was small, but still an evening and morning swim
basically directly from your room was really enjoyable.  The only
downside was that the hotel was outside of the downtown area, in the
middle of nothing, and it was somewhat hard to find: the address is
somewhat misleading, driving directions are essential.</p>

<h2>Wednesday June 12th</h2>

<h3 id ="docomo">Visiting DoCoMoLabs USA</h3>

<p>In the morning, James Kempf came to the hotel and we drove for a
quick breakfast, continuing to DoCoMoLabs 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.docomolabs-usa.com/">DoCoMoLabs USA</a>
office, located close to San Jose airport.  James and I discussed
mostly issues related to Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) BoF, planned
for Yokohama.  I was also able to synchronize my e-mail using their
conveniently open outside-of-the-firewall WLAN.</p>

<p>The main part of the visit was 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.tml.hut.fi/~pnr/presentations/DoCoMo-hip-slides.pdf">
my talk</a> 
about HIP.  I think everybody got a much
better understanding what HIP is, but it also become clear that I need
to add a couple of slides about the actual protocol into the
presentation.</p>

<p>For lunch we went to San Jose Hilton.
Food was OK but featureless.   Grabbing a mandatory 
triple cappucino I headed towards 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.stanfordbookstore.com/">Stanford University bookstore</a>, 
spending there a couple of hours reading 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262640414/pekkanikander">
The Invisible Computer</a> by
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~norman/">Don Norman.</a>   
Great book, highly recommended.
Chapter 6, "The power of infrastructure", is especially related to
Ericsson business and all systems and middleware kind of stuff.</p>

<h3 id="berson">Dinner at Tom Berson's</h3>

<p>
<img alt="Tom Berson"

     height="150"></p>

<p>I had the pleasure of having a dinner at 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.anagram.com/berson/">Tom Berson</a>'s place. 
Tom showed me his ham gear, and we talked a little bit about
trust, universe, and everything.  Dorothy's mixed green salad was just
excellent, and I learned how to eat baby artichokes.  </p>

<p>Afterwards my drive south to Monterey was almost an adventure.  I
took a couple of detours due to sleep deprivation and lacking maps,
but finally arrived at 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.marriott.com/epp/default.asp?MarshaCode=MRYCA">Monterey Marriot</a>
at 10:30pm.</p>

<h2>Thursday June 13th</h2>

<h3 id="name">Lawrence Lessig</h3>

<p>
<img alt="Larry Lessig"
     src="/web/20120408015509im_/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/contact/pictures/lessig_pillar_small.jpg"></p>

<p>The 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix02/">
Usenix Conference</a>
was opened with a keynote by
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/">Lawrence Lessig</a>.
I had never before had a chance to listen to him, and it was a joy.
He is an exceptionally good speaker.</p>

<p>The speach itself did not contain any real surprices or new
insights, as far as I remember.  But that's only because I had already
read so many of his writings.  His basic message came out loud and
clearly: We techies can't ignore the copyright wars that are going on.
Basically, he drew a high number of parallels between earlier cases
where the copyright law was challenged or extended, like when the
congress set up a mandatory licensing scheme for cable TV companies,
(the broadcasting companies were forced to license their content to
the cable TV operators, at a price determined by the goverment), 
the fights when the VCRs were brought to the market, etc. </p>

<p>I do not want to repeat all his argumentation here.  If you are not
familar with it, you can check 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/">his website</a>.

<h3>The rest of the day</h3>

<p>I was pretty tired, and so the only talk that I listened to was about
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Projects/JX/">JX operating system,</a> 
and only the send half of thet
presentation.  JX is an i386 operating system written almost
completely in Java, and supporting only Java runtime.  The talk wasn't
that good, and the would have benefitted from some improvements.
However, I found the talk quite fascinating from a long term
development point-of-view.  The fact that one can build microkernels
using an object-oriented programming language is a fascinating one.</p>

<p>I had lunch at Fisherman's Warf, eating
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.kitchenproject.com/html/The_Clam_Chowder_Page.html">
clam chowder in a sour dough bread</a>, which seems to be local
tourist attaction stuff.  It was OK, but nothing especial.</p>

<p>I was very tired all the day.  Thus, I went to my hotel room at 4pm
to take a nap, and woke up the next time at 5am next morning.</p>

<h2>Friday June 14th</h2>

<p>I was hungry as a wulf when I finally got to breakfast by 7am.  Thus,
I ate a ton of bacon, sausages, a pouched egg, fruit, etc.</p>

<h3>My presentation</h3>

<p>
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.tml.hut.fi/~pnr/presentations/Freenix2002-slides.pdf">
My presentation</a> was in the middle of the first Freenix session.
While in the 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.tml.hut.fi/~pnr/publications/Freenix2002-Nikander.pdf">
paper</a>
I write mostly about the technical details of our
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.tml.hut.fi/~pnr/EAPOL/">802.1x implementation</a>,
in the talk I covered more the background and some lesson's learned.
The talk wasn't any specific success, I could have made much better.
Shees, maybe I am getting lazy.</p>

<p>Skipped lunch; I wasnt' hungry fater the large breakfast I had
had.</p>

<h3 id="honey">People, people, people</h3>

<p>
Friday was my day for meeting people.  First
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey/">Peter Honeyman</a> 
dug me up.  He is a really nice guy,
and for some strange reason interested about what I am doing.  Right
now he wants to implement a single sign on system that uses a cell
phone and Bluetooth as the primary technologies.  Extremely cool.
IMHO, we should really put some cycles on this, and make sure he
can fulfil his vision.  Besides, I would like to use that system,
too!
</p>

<p>Next I bumped to 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.hillside.co.uk/pcsig.html">Peter Collinson.</a>  
I think I had met him last in 1986
or so in an EUUG workshop at Nice, but maybe later.  He is still
working as freelance consultance, mostly running websites with his own
software.  Among other things, he manages the Usenix website.
</p>

<p id="hagen">
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.isc.org/ISC/hagen.html">Teus Hagen</a> is also one of the old
farts from EUUG days.  He and his pals used to run the Neatherlands
part of the EUUG network, EUnet, sold it to Worldcom, and founded 
the 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.nlnet.nl/">Stifting NLnet</a>
foundation with the money they got.  The foundation's goal is to fund
open source projects.</p>

<p>I told Teus about HIIT's open source search engine idea, and he
found it interesting.  Thus, I'll try to put together Martti and him,
and see if something comes out of that.  It might also be a good idea
to seek funding for our HIP work, maybe for Janne Lundberg.</p>

<p id="pike">Peter Honeyman also introduced me to
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/rob/">Rob Pike</a>, 
one of the real Unix guru's from AT&amp;T
Bell Labs.  Rob is a really nice guy.  For example, realizing that I
am a Finn, he vent to utter "hyvaa paivaa" (good afternoon) and "yksi,
kaksi, kolme, nelja, viisi, kuusi"  (one, two, ..., six).  He had been
to Finland in 1987 at the EUUG boat conference, I guess, or in the
late 1980's anyway.</p>

<h4 id="venti">Venti</h4>

<p>One of the things we talked with Rob was 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/fast02/quinlan.html">
Venti</a>, a distributed block storage system.  Very cool stuff.  The
basic idea of Venti is that you store blocks (not files) of arbitrary
sizes.  When you store a block in venti, it returns a SHA1 hash of the
block.  This hash functions as a handle to the block.  That is, you
give the system a hash, and it replies with the block.</p>

<p>Blocks are never erased in Venti.  If the same block is stored
again, the data is not stored again but the same block is reused.  In
this way replication and version management is very easy.</p>

<p>The only real trick lies in designing the blocking boundaries.  For
example, if you store digital video for editing, i.e. in an
uncompressed or very lightly compressed format, you may want to store
each image as a separate block.  Sequences of images would be stored
by putting the hashes of the individual blocks in a block, and storing
that block.  Breaking the sequences at suitable boundaries,
e.g. whenever there is a cut, would allow reuse of sequences, as
well.  In that way the actual image data would never need to be
copied, and most of the natural sequencing could be reused as well.
Implementing Venti for Mac OS X looks like a pretty nice project...
</p>
 
<h3>WIPs</h3>

<p>
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://gunpowder.stanford.edu/~mgbaker/">Mary Baker</a> hosted the
Work-in-Progress (WIP) session.  Apparently I was in a wrong
conference since I didn't find almost any of the WIPs interesting
enough to mention.  The most interesting one was yet another talk
about network security.  In the conference WLAN, there had been the
usual amount of clear text passwords, open Windows shares, port
scanning, windows exloits, attempts to use scanned passwords on SSH
connections, etc. 
</p>

<p>After the session I went saying Hello to Mary Baker, but didn't
want to bother her more since I knew she was busy with her family.</p>

<h3>Dinner with Angelos Keromytis</h3>

<p>
<img alt="Rappa's Seafood Restaurant"
     src="/web/20120408015509im_/http://www.rappas.com/webart/pic_index.jpg"
     width="200"></p>

<p>
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~angelos/">Angelos Keromytis</a>
and I went to 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.rappas.com/">Rappa's Seafood Restaurant</a>
for dinner. 
I had their seafood combination platter.  It was OK, but again nothing
exception.  Bad trip from the food point of view -- no good food, only 
average. </p>

<p>Basically, Angelos and I decided to write together a paper to next 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.di.ens.fr/FC03/cfp.html">Financial Cryptography</a> 
conference, to be held in 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.cieux.com/gdlp.html">Guadeloupe.</a>

<h3>Reception at Monterey Aquarium</h3>

<p>After the dinner I went for a short walk, trying to walk to the
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/">Monterey Aquarium</a>
over the hill, but failed.  That is, I needed to
came back to the shore line and the the walkway there. </p>

<p>The aquarium is just great.  This time they had unsually large
jelly fish exhibit, and I enjoyed it greatly.  It was also interesting
to learn that there is actually a very large underwater canyon,
starting almost immediately outside Monterey.  The exhibits also
displayed a number of deep sea species.</p>

<h2>Saturday June 15th</h2>

<p>I tried to start the morning by following refereed track talks.
Somewhat interesting, but not really worth mentioning, IMHO.
Go to the 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix02/tech/techonefile.html">
proceedings</a> 
if you are interested in
geographical mapping of routers, proximity of web clients and their
closest DNS servers, etc.</p>

<h3>Bill Cheswick</h3>

<p>Since the refereed track stuff was not that great, I went to a guru
session to listen to
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ches/">Bill Cheswick</a>.
Entertaining and fun, but I was at least vaguely aware of most of the
stuff.  He is clearly more paranoid than I am, and relies more on old
and simple software than I do, but maybe he has more to lose if
someone hacks to his systems than I do.</p>

<p>At the end of the session he was asked to tell a story.  It went
like this.  Bill was giving an invited talk in San Jose two years ago.
He checked out his laptop for the presentation in good time, some 20
minutes before the talk was due.  However, he needed to do some
business in the bathroom, ventured to a quiet area in the hotel, and
found a bathroom.  He did his business, and came out from the stall.
To his horror he found that the door was locked.  He banged on the
door, but no-one came to help.  Fortunately he had some tools in his
backback, so out he took them and managed to pick the lock.  With sigh
of relieve he opened the door, and indinigtly stepped into the
janitor's room, only to notice that there was a door without any lock
right on his back.   The moral of the story: Make sure you are solving
the right problem.</p>

<h3 id="schneier">Bruce Schneier</h3>

<p>After the break I went to follow 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.counterpane.com/schneier.html">Bruce Schneier</a>'s
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.counterpane.com/presentation4.pdf">
invited talk.</a> His slides are excellent, check them.  The main
moral is that security is a part of the net, and the limits of
security become the limits of the net.  If you can't do it securely,
you are going to stop doing it.  To make the net a secure place, we
need liability.  That may cause problems for free software or small
startups, but not necessarily.  He also talked about the role of
insurancde industry in the process.  In his view, in the future
security can be viewed as a city.  We need a dynamic, very context
sensitive definition of security that we revise all the time in our
real life.</p>

<p>The discussion that ensued after the talk was quite interesting.
In the following I've tried to distill some essential insights.
Firstly, the issue of liability is really a question of a delicate
interplay between government law and insurance companies.  Law is
never perfect.  Matt Blaze has once said that Computer Science is a
search for the truth, lAw is a search for the concensus.  Bruce noted
that in the current situation big companies are basically buying laws
for themselves.  There is no magical technological fix for that; we
need a whole new legal infrastructure.</p>

<p>Niels Provost (Peter Honeyman's student) asked Bruce to clarify his
claims about the affordability of security, and whether uniform (and
therefore inexpensive) tools form a risk, leading to a situation where
only the rich can afford real security.  Bruce answered that in our
real life non-digital society, everybody <em>can</em> afford basic
security.  Since we live in lawful society, the average person doesn't
need walls and guards in their house.  He acknowledged that systems of
diverse types will be more survivable and more secure.  However, we
already now have just a few security products, not even hundreds or
millions.  For example, there are only three wide spread firewall
products in the market.  If there were more products, then
heterogneity would really matter, but not in the current situation.

<p>In many of his answers, Bruce emphasized that all solutions are
imperfect.  Legistlation is a random walk towards convergence.  There
will be spectacular failures.  It takes time before we really
understand the time and space shifting abilities of the technology.
Furthermore, there will always be domains in the planet that do not
fall into these legistlations.  Maybe there will be good and bad
countries, and a wall in between.  Or maybe we can deal the situation
in a way similar to how we deal with uninsured motorists.</p>

<p>One interesting idea that came up would be a mandatory individual
liability insurance, that woudl come with your computer or ISP connection.
Like mandatory traffic liability insurance.  That might fit into the
U.S. system, but I am personally sceptical about the European case.</p>

<p>In the end, Matt Blaze asked whether Bruce has any
<em>advice</em> for the rest of us.  He replied that liability is
coming, sooner or later.  The security problems will be solved through
the legal framework.  So, we should think how this interplay will
affect us, whether we write free software or deal with standards.  We
don't have that lot of lobbying dollars.  This is happening whether we
like or not.  We need to understand it and get ahead it.
</p>

<h3>Technical sessions</h3>

<p>
In the afternoon technical session there was one interesting paper, 
<strong><a href="/web/20120408015509/http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix02/savarese.html">
Robust Position Algorithms for Distributed Ad-hoc Networks</a></strong>

by Chris Savarese from
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC).</a>
His work is related to the 
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Pico_Radio/Default.htm">
Picoradio project</a>
going on at BWRC.  In their vision, there is an ad hoc radio network
of very small nodes, all nodes being equal other than some very few
nodes (anchor nodes) know their location e.g. by GPS.  Everything is
distributed.<p>

<p>
The problem in hand is estimating the geographical location of the
nodes, using information about the locations of the anchor points.
However, usually the radio range of the nodes is so small that they
can't hear enough anchor points, often not even one.  Thus, the nodes
need to first estimate their location based on hop counts, and then
revise the estimates based on estimates.  A confidence factor comes to
play as well, to detect bad nodes.  However, that approach seemed to
be collaborative and not able to guard against intentionally malicious
nodes.</p>

<p>One of the intesting results was that if you range errors are very
high, perhaps larger than 40%, refinement (as used) does not seem to
help, but hop count seems to be relatively immune towards range
estimate errors.</p>

<h3>Special Closing Session</h3>

<p>In the Usenix tradition, the last session is always something
special.  This time professor
<a href="/web/20120408015509/http://ib.berkeley.edu/faculty/dickinsonm.html">Michael H. Dickinson</a> 
from UC Berkeley 
presented his research on <strong>How flies fly</strong>.
Fascinating, given the very small number of neurons involved.  Only
through this kind of research one is able to understand how complex
systems the evolution is really able to produce, and how the
interconnections within such a system may look like almost wild 
and arbitrary, but they do work in a very efficient way.</p>

<p>After the talk, I was able to drive safely back to SFO, and got on
my plan in time.  This report was written mostly during the
transatlantic flight.</p>

<h2>Sunday June 16th</h2>

<p>
For me, Sunday June 16th did not really exist.  That is, I sat on the
plane, wrote this travel report, and worked on a paper for the
forthcoming workshop on Trust Management and related issues.
