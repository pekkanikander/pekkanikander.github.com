<h1>Anonymous Identifiers (ALIEN) BoF</h1>

<p>These are the minutes for the Anonymous Identifiers (ALIEN) BoF
  held during the 62nd IETF meeting on on Wednesday, April 3rd 2005,
  at 2pm - 4:30pm in Paris, France.  Thanks to Andrew McGrecor and
  Julien Laganier, on whose notes these minutes are based on.</p>

<p>These minutes have been compiled
  by <a href="/web/20120407203338/http://www.iki.fi/~pnr/">Pekka Nikander</a>, one of the
  BoF co-chairs, and sent to the momipriv and saag mailing lists for
  verification. </p>
  
<p>The purpose of this BoF was to discuss to discuss three different issues: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether to form a privacy-related Research Group at the IRTF</li>
  <li>Whether to charter a new Working Group in the Security Area</li>
  <li>Whether to charter new working items for existing Working Groups</li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, during the meeting it became clear that the suggested
  approach does not work.  In general, this experience indicates that
  trying to charter an IRTF Research Group and an IETF Working Group
  on a single BoF may not work well unless there is considerably
  pre-existing work on the topic, as was the case when the HIP WG and
  RG where discussed.</p>

<p>The positive output from the BoF was that there seems to be
  considerable interest in this area among both the mobility and
  security people.  There seems also to be a fair amount of energy,
  with over 10 people interested in working towards an IRTF RG and at
  least 6 people interested in organising a workshop on the topic.</p>

<p>The negative output from the BoF was that the security (and
  probably also other) people felt that we do not understand the
  problems we are trying to solve. We do not understand the problem
  even in the limited scope of MAC and IP addresses.  Many people also
  felt that solving the problem only at the link and IP layers is not
  enough alone, but the approach should be more comprehensive.</p>

<p>In some discussions afterwards a number of people expressed their
  concerns about the proposed limited WG of not having formed.  It
  looks like that there is a need and real energy in the community,
  and it is well possible that there may be another attempt in the
  next IETF meeting, provided that people are able to work out a good
  enough problem statement and threat model.  However, it must be
  duly noted that the level of detail must be much better thought out
  before a new BoF could take place. </p>

<p>As the next steps, the following seems to be likely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Form a new mailing list with the intention of chartering a
    Research Group at the IRTF.  The list is intended to eventually
    become the RG discussion list.</li>
  <li>Initiate discussion on the RG charter, with the intention of
    submitting it to the IRTF chair and IAB latest in October.</li>
  <li>Start working out the more specific threat analyses for two
  problem scopes:
    <ul>
      <li>A larger, more comprehensive scope</li>
      <li>A narrower scope, focusing on IPsec (including IKE) and
      layers below
      </li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Start working out details for a workshop to kick start the
    Research Group work in this area.  When writing this (on Friday
    after the IETF meeting) it looks like that such a workshop, were
    it to take place, most probably will <em>not</em> be an IAB
    workshop, even though there may be IAB members participating.</li>
</ul>

<div id="details">
<a name="details"></a><h2>Presentations and Discussion</h2>

<h3>Agenda and Introduction</h3>

<p>The chairs introduced the BoF by discussing the current situation
  where it is fairly easy to correlate link layer, IP layer and upper
  layer identifiers, thereby collecting comprehensive communication
  profiles about both stationary and mobile users.  This is becoming
  more a problem due to increased mobility, allowing the communication
  profile to be annotated with the (approximate) location of the users
  at any given time.  Existing and anticipated legistlation in some
  countries, European Union being the prime example, requires that
  the systems must not disclose privacy-related information about the
  users without their concent. </p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is that we need to have a balance between
  identifiability and anonymity.  Full anonymity would probably lead
  to more unwanted traffic, including Denial of Service attacks and
  various forms of Spam.</p>

<p>The chairs then outlined the proposed approach, which consisted of
  the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider forming a Research Group
      <ul>
	<li> Understanding the larger problem space 
	  (privacy in Internet protocols)</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Consider forming a Working Group
      <ul>
	<li>Focus on implementation guidelines and gap analysis</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Consider new working working items for existing WGs
      <ul>
	<li>Should we change existing protocols?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<dl>
 <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>You could do 2 [implementation guidelines
  and gap analysis] as a part of 1 [in a Research Group]; you don't
  need a working group for that.  As I understand it, Research Groups
  can publish documents as guidelines. </dd>
  <dt>Pekka Nikander:</dt><dd>We'll consider this; that will be part
  of the open discussion towards the end.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Terms and definitions</h3>

<p>Erik Nordmark gave a presentation giving defintions for the
  following terms, as defined
  in <a href="/web/20120407203338/http://koti.welho.com/pnikande/draft-haddad-momipriv-problem-statement-01.txt">
    draft-haddad-momipriv-problem-statement-01.txt</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymity</li>
  <li>Pseudonymity</li>
  <li>Unlinkability</li>
  <li>Privacy</li>
</ul>

<p>There was some discussion about the terms.  Erik noted that perfect
  anonymity may not be technically possible.  Rajeev wanted to know
  what is meant with the term "entity", is it a device, a user, or
  what?  Erik answered that an entity may be different in different
  cases.  For example, a VPN gateway is a device used by potentially
  hundreds of devices, and there may not be any mapping from the
  gateway to individual devices or users.  Rajeev noted that there
  seems to be a mistake in the definitions at least in the slides:  If
  there are two actions, and if at least one of them is fully
  anonymous, that is sufficient for not being able to correlate that
  action back to a given entity.  [The slide stated that if there are
  two anonymous actions, they cannot be correlated back to "A".]</p>

<p>There was some discussion between Eric Rescorla, Erik Nordmark, and
  Rajeev Koodlin about the relationship between anonymity and
  unlinkability, mainly whether unlinkability is a sufficient
  condition to anonymity and whether anonymity implies
  unlinkability.  Rejeev stated that he might want to unlinkability
  but not anonymity.  Erik replied that if any of your acts can be
  linked back to your identity, your identifier sets become
  linkable.</p> 

<p>Hesham Soliman asked if type of service is supposed to be private,
  and Erik replied that one may not want to disclose that he or she
  has gold service.</p>

<h3>Proposed Scope for the planned work</h3>

<p>Pekka Nikander presented a few slides on the proposed scope.
  Basically, the idea is to focus on making identifiers unlinkable,
  thereby achieving some level of anonymity or pseudonymity towards
  third parties.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>Doesn't this presume we understand what
   unlinkability actually is, and that you know a solution to
   unlinkability, and how these could be fitted into existing
   protocols.?</dd>
  <dt>Pekka Nikander:</dt><dd>Personally, I think we do.  There are
    already two solutions; I think we roughly know how to solve the
    issues (but I may be wrong).</dd>
  <dt>Rajeev:</dt><dd>This should be done into the existing groups.</dd> 
  <dt>Alper Yegin:</dt><dd> Is there's a limitation on the kind of
    identifiers we are dealing with </dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>That is to be discussed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>One example approach</h3>

<p>Pekka Nikander presented one potential solution approach, presented
  previously at the 2005 Cambridge Security Protocols workshop.  He
  also noted that there <em>may</em> be IPR issues with the
  approach.</p>

<p>The basic idea of the presented approach is to replace constant
  identifiers with jointly agreed pseudo-random sequences of
  identifiers.  The first paper in the area was presented already in
  1977, but the work has gained new interested only recently.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd>These set of IDs would need to be
    exchanged at the beginning</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Yes.</dd>
  <dt>Hesham:</dt><dd>It is matter to exchange the initial seed value?</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Yes.  We expect to use a kye management protocol.</dd>
  <dt>Hesham:</dt><dd>Could this apply to IP addresses as well. What
    about collisions with IPv6</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Yes, in theory you can apply this to IPv6
    address, too.  You don't care about collisions there, you just
    move on to the next ID set.</dd>
  <dt>Hesham:</dt><dd>To bootstrap the relationship, you would need to
    use an identifier that can be semi-permanent.  Will that kill the
    scheme.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Not necessarily, you have identity protection with HIP
    or possibly with IKEv2; see the BLIND paper given in the
    references.</dd>

  <dt>Eric Rescorla:</dt><dd>What is the threat model?  In v4, you
    can't blind the IP address, so blinding everything else doesn't
    buy that much.</dd> 
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Yes, in v4 this would probably require to change
    the way you use the IP addresses.  What I presented is an one example
    of the solution space we could explore.</dd>
  <dt>Eric:</dt><dd>I'd like to ask that the next speaker be more
    explicit about the threat model.</dd> 
  <dt>Greg Daley:</dt><dd>Work on changing existing protocols can be
    pushed back to their WGs.  But, with a model like this, you could
    have a single session between two hosts that would protect all
    concurrent sessions; a privacy bootstrap protocol.  That may be a
    worthwhile work item.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Quite a lot depends on your definition of
    protocols: perhaps you don't change packet format, just the way
    the state in end-nodes is used.</dd>
  <dt>Alper Yegin:</dt><dd>Can you explain againk how does the
    implicit origin authentication work?</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd> Only the sender and receiver knows the random
    sequences.  If there is enough entropy in the changing
    identifiers, it is very unlikely that another entity is able to
    generate the same sequence.</dd>
  <dt>Alper:</dt><dd>But it doesn't really secure the contents of the
    all packets.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Right, it's not really true security in that
    sense.</dd>
  <dt>Glen Travers:</dt><dd>You talk about no extra bits and
    zero-signalling mobility, but wont't this generate extra traffic?</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>You are right.  In practice it will.</dd>
  <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>You still need to run return routability,
      on something that is routable.  This implies it's not exactly
      zero-signalling.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>Yes, you are right.</dd>
  <dt>Rich Draves:</dt><dd> So there is extra bits on the wires. So is
    there is anything revealed to the receiver of the spurious ACKs?</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>I'm not sure but I think not.  I would need to
    look at that more.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>MIPv6 Privacy Extensions</h3>

<p>Gabriel Montenegro presented another example approach, dealing with
  Mobile IPv6.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd> If you do RO, you still get the TMI</dd>
  <dt>Gabriel Montenegro:</dt><dd>Yes the TMI is an index to the encrypted HoA.
    If you are a server, yes you can't hide your home address, it's too late
    to hide it.</dd>
  <dt>Hesham:</dt><dd>Can a server avoid revealing much of its
    identity? no hang on, that's probably not doable.</dd>
  <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd> There where few proposal to address that
    in the past, how to mask HoA.</dd>
  <dt>Gab:</dt><dd>Yes, this one example of known techniques.</dd>
  <dt>Rajeev:</dt><dd>How can you recover the HoA from the
    pseudo-identifier?  We've looked at this...  you still need to run
    return routability on the original HA.</dd>
  <dt>Gab:</dt><dd>Remember that TMI is not routable, structurally so.</dd>
  <dt>Nico Williams:</dt><dd> It seems the first proposal could work
    very well in open networks.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Trade-offs between anonymity and identifiability</h3>

<p>Bob Hinden led a brief discussion about some of the tradeoffs
  involved.</p> 

<dl>
  <dt>Steve Bellovin:</dt><dd> Who is enemy, what is the threat model?
    Examples with SPAM, DoS is not about IP address forgery.</dd>
  <dt>James Kempf:</dt><dd>We don't actually have a threat
    analysis.</dd>
  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd>I share Bob's concerns. But, if there is
    a negotiation, people could choose not to use a service if anonymity
    is not possible.If you allow resource allocation, what is the impact
    of that and the updates during sessions.</dd>
  <dt>Bob Hinden:</dt><dd>I have no answers; I just think the WG needs
    to think about these questions</dd>
  <dt>Raj Patil:</dt><dd> Anonymizing identity is one thing, Pekka
    mentioned that regulations will mandates that.  There is more needs to
    maintains identity as per other regulations, than to anonymize
    it.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>That tends to depend on the environment, but yes.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Threats to lower layers</h3>

<p>Wassim Haddad discussed the current draft about lower layer thread
  model.</p>

<h3>Lower layers problem statement</h3>

<p>Erik Nordmark presented the current draft concerning the problems
  perceived to exist w.r.t. unlinkability at the IP layer and
  below.</p> 

<p>Reconstructing the following piece of discussion was hard due to
  the big differences between the two sets of notes.  The main points
  seemed to be the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is possible to fingerprint radios based on the RF signals;
    consequently, hiding the MAC doesn't help much unless you also
    consider bridging.</li>
  <li>In most access networks you still need to give your identity
    to the AAA server; consequently, there are potential problems
    with EAP in this space.</li>
  <li>Changing MAC addresses might still be useful against
    resource-constrained eavesdroppers. </li>
</ul>


<dl>
  <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>CoA disclosure out of scope? [Yes]</dd>
  <dt>Eric Rescorla:</dt><dd>I think we're concentrating on locator unlinkability.</dd>
  <dt>Rajeev:</dt><dd>Mipv6 has been looking at this.</dd>
  <dt>Eric:</dt><dd> Are you assuming the only access the attacker has
    to wireless traffic is through the MAC interface?  If they can
    fingerprint your radio, there is no point hiding the MAC
    address.</dd>
  <dt>Eric Rescorla:</dt><dd>When you authenticate at a link, don't
    you give your identity to the RADIUS server anyway?</dd>
  <dt>Steve Bellovin:</dt><dd>Yes...</dd>
  <dt>Erik Nordmark:</dt><dd>Right, so let's keep it in mind</dd>
  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd>Today they know which phone device you have.</dd>
  <dt>Erik:</dt><dd>But there is temporary IMSI, TMSI</dd>
  <dt>Hesham:</dt><dd>TMSI is used only after authentication</dd>
  <dt>Christian Huitema:</dt><dd>On hot-spots, you anyway to pay so
    you need to be identified.  You might change your MAC address as often
    as you want but it doesn't help</dd>
  <dt>Erik:</dt><dd>Unless you have many credit cards.</dd>
  <dt>Alper Yegin:</dt><dd> In some mode, the MAC address is not in
    the frames in .16, only seen on the air when you authenticate, and you
    might even hide them during authentication. So there's not that much
    concerns with the fact that .16 addresses appears in
    certificates.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Open mikes discussion</h3>

<p>(Discussion continues, notes again agreeing.)</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>It's good to look at unlinkability and
    pseudonimity aspects.  I'd like to make the distinction between
    location privacy with IP addresses in general, and IP addresses as
    used by MIP (i.e. HoA, and CoA).</dd>
  <dt>Sam Hartman (AD):</dt><dd>Before we discuss about the approach,
    let's make sure we understand the problem.</dd>
  <dt>Pekka:</dt><dd>I'll ask two questions: Do we understand
    the narrow problem of unlinkability, and then which approach to
    follow: wider or more focused.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Unconclusive hums about understanding the problem.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Alper Yegin:</dt><dd>Still don't have a clear boundary for this.
    My main concerns is about scope, and which layer coordination
    issues go. I still don't have a clear boundary where we are going
    to stop this work.  Also about L2.  I think we need to further
    discuss the scope.</dd>

  <dt>Sam Hartman:</dt><dd> There is jabber discussion saying that we
    don't understand WHAT problem we are trying to solve.</dd>

  <dt>Pekka Nikander:</dt><dd> That's why I think there may be a need
    for a research group.  But it also seems like there may be smaller
    issues that can clearly be attacked in existing contexts.  First
    I'd want to discuss about the approach : what work to solve in the
    WG, and what in other fora.</dd>

  <dt>Steve Bellovin:</dt><dd> I don't think we don't understand even
    the basics well enough because there are so many possible
    variants.  We don't understand what we're trying to protect
    against well enough.  There are things for individual groups,
    clearly.  A research group might be good, but working
    group... When I was AD I tried to have people write RFC about what
    guidelines and introduce a privacy considerations requirement for
    documents, but it did not succeed.  But save a focused group until
    we have a clear idea.  A WG should exist to solve a narrow
    problem.</dd>

  <dt>Christian Huitema:</dt><dd> What/who are we protecting against?
    Are you protecting against neighbors , ISPs, .... I don't believe
    a research group will be that useful.  What would be useful would
    be to develop a threat model.  You can do as much RGs as you want,
    that's what researcher do.</dd>

  <dt>Bob Morgan:</dt><dd>I'd certainly say we don't understand
    anything... for a WG.  There's been work on pseudonymous
    identifiers around, but not in IETF.  I support the RG
    concept.</dd>

  <dt>Raj Patil:</dt><dd> Who exactly is asking that there is a need
    for such privacy?  And about MAC address problem: it is IEEE
    business, not IETF.</dd>

  <dt>James Kempf:</dt><dd> So you're asking who is the customer for
    privacy.</dd>

  <dt>Raj:</dt><dd> Exactly.</dd>

  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd>First an RG is fine, good idea. We would
    need a holistic approach along Pekka's proposal, but I don't think
    we're anywhere near that.  Almost need a survey of all protocols,
    and make sure that everyone understands this, and design like that
    for a long period, otherwise one small feature of one new protocol
    can break the whole thing.  Maybe we need to look at where the
    holes are.  What is the impact of that, or to allow such
    scheme. If we have a Privacy consideration in RFC that would help
    to reach a common understanding of what are the problems.</dd>

  <dt>Greg Daley:</dt><dd> I agree that we need to have a very narrow
    scope for a WG.  There is still a need for this sort of thing.  We
    have existing protocols that expose the identifiers in various
    places.  Things like MIP do not provide unlinkability.  The are
    customers for existing protocols, but it is not the full
    solution. We might get advice on what not to do in the short time.
    It would also be nice to have some guidance from the IAB as to
    what we know now.</dd>

  <dt>John Loughney:</dt><dd>I hummed no [to the question of whether
    we understand the problem]; we need to better understand what we
    are trying to solve. Guidelines and gap analysis is premature.</dd>

  <dt>Gabriel Montenegro:</dt><dd> I like the idea of having privacy
    considerations in RFC.  In terms of a security area WG, I like the
    idea of people working on this.  An IAB workshop inviting people
    who might be customer of this might be good, for example, people
    like European policy makers. People that understand what are the
    problem might provide us a starting point to look for technical
    solutions.  Then get clear idea of who customers are etc.</dd>

  <dt>Raj Patil:</dt><dd> A RG makes a lot of sense.  Once there are
    documents coming out of that, we might understand better.  That
    might be a good time to have a workshop.  The issue for MIP6 is
    addressed right now in the WG, and the scope is limited.</dd>

  <dt>Alper Yegin:</dt><dd> Bob Hinden's presentation has many
    questions, that need to be analyzed before we move forward.</dd>

  <dt>Hesham Soliman:</dt><dd> I don't think we should invite policy
    makers because they are the people we try to hide from, they are
    not the real customers.</dd>

  <dt>Rajeev Koodli:</dt><dd>Fine with RG.  Workshop seems like a good
    idea, too, modulo attendee list.</dd>


  <dt>Leslie Daigle [wearing the IAB chair hat]:</dt><dd> Sounds like
    there could be the basis for an RG, also conceivable that an IAB
    workshop might come of this, however focus may be an issue.  Needs
    to have a well framed and scoped proposal so that there is chance
    of producing useful output, or an IAB workshop won't work. There
    are also many (practical) steps between thinking of a workshop
    idea and having one -- so if a workshop doesn't follow, this group
    should not be completely unwarned.  In terms of the suggestion
    about IAB guidance, the IAB doesn't hand down guidance from on
    high -- workshops are indeed our most common form of work.  In
    terms of forming an RG -- the word should be "propose" an RG, not
    "form" an RG -- you are welcome to poll this room to guage
    interest in, and proposal for an RG, but it's input to the RG
    creation process. </dd>

  <dt>Pekka Savola:</dt><dd> Do you think that a threat model belongs
    to the IRTF or should that be elsewhere?</dd>
</dl>

<p>The discussion was followed by a number of questions to the room:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do you think we should try to identify and analyze the problem
    [better than what we have done so far]?  <em>Yes.</em></li>
  <li>Should we propose forming an IRTF Research Group in this space?
    <em>Yes.</em></li> 
  <li>Who are willing to work on an RG, and write documents?  <em>Steve
    Bellovin, Alper Yegin, Francis Dupont, Wassim Haddad, Pekka
    Nikander, James Kempf, others; <strong>please identify 
	yourself.</strong></em></li>
  <li>Who are willing to work towards a workshop?  <em>Steve Bellovin,
    Alper Yegin, Rajeev Koodli, Gabriel Montenegro, Pekka Nikander,
    James Kempf; maybe others.</em></li> 
</ol>

<dl>
  <dt>Nico Williams:</dt><dd>Who is the customer and who is the
  implementer?</dd>

  <dt>Steve Bellovin:</dt><dd>Threat model is topic #1 for the
    proposed RG, not for 8 minutes now.  Too big.</dd> 
  
  <dt>Unknown speaker:</dt><dd>Part of this will be influenced by
    influenced by regulations, public policy. We should not go to far
    with threat model documentation before the workshop.  There will
    be feedback.  There are W3C groups looking at some related areas
    too.</dd>

  <dt>Unknown speaker 2:</dt><dd>Workshop first is a good idea, since
    there can be inconsistent legal requirements.</dd>
